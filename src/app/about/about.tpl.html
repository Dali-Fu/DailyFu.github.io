    <p class="aboutParagraph">
      前路迢迢，又到一站。 此间遇到许许多多帮助过我的人，也帮助过他人 让许多老师失望过，也对许多老师失望过 自然也学了一些东西，懂了一些道理，做了一点工作 许多人视其为一段历程的结束，新一段历程的开始 但人生不应分段 整个人生就是一场经历 结果已无意义 唯时间流逝 唯望今后 多做些工作，做点事情，好好生活，认真学习 让这时光匆匆而不觉无聊 便已无憾 若能有益他人 遗后世二三事 则更幸甚至哉

      One year ago as luck will have it, I stumbled upon learning about coding bootcamps. I have always had an interest in technology and programming, so in the midst of self-discovery with nothing to lose, I packed my bags, moved from one big city to another (NY - SF), and enrolled at Hack Reactor. 
    </p><p class="aboutParagraph">
      Subsequent to graduating the program, Hack Reactor hired me to stay on for a few months assisting the new incoming students. It has been an invigorating experience to see where I was, how far I’ve come, to eventually helping others achieve the same. I love being a part of that community but now I’m ready for my next adventure.   
    </p><p class="aboutParagraph">
      I am a full-stack software engineer with a focus in javascript. I have experience with frameworks such as backbone, angular, and react. I also have backend experience with node.js/express. If you have a job opportunity/lead to my next expedition, let’s grab coffee or boba!
